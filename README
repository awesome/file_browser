= DESCRIPTION

A rails plugin that provides a basic file browser. The primary use
case for this plugin is:

* To manage a directory of files includes subdirectories
* To integration with products like CKEditor for selecting files.

Guiding Principals:

* No database required
* Multiple backends (filesystem, S3, etc.) - Filesystem only currently
* Pluggable integration with 3rd party products such as CKEditor

Possible Future Features:

* Launcher can specify only certain file types to show
  (images only, only certain extensions, etc.)
* Allow basic image manipulation (resize, crop, etc.)
* File upload progress monitoring (for large files)

= SETUP

In your environment.rb add:

    config.gem 'file_browser'

In an initializer add:

    FileBrowser.storages[:local] =
      FilesystemStorage.new Rails.root.join('public/uploaded_files')

Change the above path to be wherever you want to write files. Also make
sure that directory is writable by the application.

Next run `rake file_browser:assets:copy` to copy the necessary
javascript, CSS and images to your public directory. You can feel free
to update those files. The copy only happens when you run the rake task.
Note that you need to put `require 'file_browser/rails_tasks'` in your
Rakefile for the rake tasks to be included in your app.

Finally point your browser to /local/uploaded_files/index and start
managing your files via the web.

See example_integrations directory for how to integrate with 3rd party
tools such as CKEditor.

= CONFIGURATION

By default the app will use the "file_browser" layout. Obviously your
can override that in your application if you want. If you want it to
use the same layout as your main layout simply symlink
file_browser.html.erb to your application.html.erb file. If you use
your own layout make sure that it includes the prototype library and
that it yields to the symbol :file_browser_footer.

You can have multiple storage repositories that can be registered and
accessed. See FileBrowser#storages for more info.
